    message: `Hello Dear MeldCX, i want to take this moment to thank you for giving me the chance to prove myself.
     I always dreamed of having a team around me, where I can learn and grow also helping them with my dedication.
     Tried to architect the flow of this app to best way possible (it will never be best i know :-)).
     Maybe I will have to spend some more time in styling and writing test for this app, but continiously updating!
     Completed:
        Component development and organisation
        Interactions with an API
        Attention to detail in design and implementation
        Component and app styling
        Ability to communicate
    Ongoing: 
        Effective testing
    Features(completed): 
        User enters any email address, and password 'meld123'
        User clicks log in
        User authenticated and taken to devices screen
        User presented with up-to-date (polls every 5 seconds) view of active devices
        User clicks 'notify' to signify completion of the test
    Additionally(completed):
        When user logs in, they should remain logged in until they click "log out", or their browser data is cleared
        If password is incorrect, error message is shown
        On the devices screen, the circles orbit around the number
        On the devices screen, the number of circles shown should equal the number of active devices
    Looking forward for your response`
