I always dreamed of having a team around me, where I can learn and grow also helping them with my dedication. I have tried to architect the flow of this app to best way possible (it will never be best i know :-)).Maybe I will have to spend some more time in styling and writing test for this app, continiously updating! Looking forward for your response'
